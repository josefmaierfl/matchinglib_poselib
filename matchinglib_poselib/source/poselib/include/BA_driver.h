	/* Constructor.
	 *
	 * bool BAfixedcal					Input  -> If the camera intrinsics are provided to perform_sba
	 *											  this variable specifies if they should be fixed or optimized
	 *											  during BA.
	 * int BAhowto						Input  -> Specifies, which parameters should be optimized:
	 *											  BA_MOTSTRUCT: Motion and structure are opimized. Thus,
	 *															the structure elements (3D points), the camera
	 *															rotation, translation and depending
	 *															on other options, the intrinsics and distortion
	 *															are optimized.
	 *											  BA_MOT:		Only the motion is optimized. Thus,
	 *															the camera rotation, translation and depending
	 *															on other options, the intrinsics and distortion
	 *															are optimized.
	 *											  BA_STRUCT:	Only the structure elements are optimized.
	 *											  BA_MOT_MOTSTRUCT: In the first place only the motion (see above)
	 *															is optimized. But if the error after optimization
	 *															is too large, both, the motion and structure
	 *															(see above) are optimized.
	 * int costfunction					Input  -> Specifies, which cost function should be used during BA:
	 *											  COST_LEASTSQUARES: The original least squares cost function is
	 *																 used.
	 *											  COST_PSEUDOHUBER: The robust pseudo-huber cost function is used.
	 *																This cost function is computational more
	 *																expensive because the least squares cost
	 *																function is part of the core algorithm of SBA
	 *																and is performed anyway - this has to be
	 *																reversed while applying the new cost function.
	 * double cost_tresh				Input  -> The threshold for the cost function. The default value should only
	 *											  be used when working in image coordinates and with the pseudo-huber
	 *											  cost function. Otherwise, please use a different threshold.
	 * int SlnPrnt						Input  -> Specifies, which results should be written back to the input
	 *											  variables (if BAuseInputVarsAsOutput = true) or which results
	 *											  are available through the get-methods (if
	 *											  BAuseInputVarsAsOutput = false). The options are the same as for
	 *											  BAhowto. This option can help saving memory or prevents
	 *											  writing back data.
	 * int BAnccalib					Input  -> Specifies which intrinsics should be kept fixed during BA (if
	 *											  intrinsics are provided to perform_sba):
	 *											  0: all parameters are free
     *											  1: skew is fixed to its initial value, all other parameters vary
	 *												 (i.e. fu, u0, v0, ar)
     *											  2: skew and aspect ratio are fixed to their initial values, all
	 *												 other parameters vary (i.e. fu, u0, v0)
     *											  3: meaningless
     *											  4: skew, aspect ratio and principal point are fixed to their
	 *												 initial values, only the focal length varies (i.e. fu)
     *											  5: all intrinsics are kept fixed to their initial values
     *											  >5: meaningless
     *											  Used only when calibration varies among cameras
	 * int BAncdist						Input  -> Specifies which distortion coeffitients of Bouguet's model
	 *											  should be kept fixed during BA (if distortion parameters are
	 *											  provided to perform_sba):
	 *											  0: all parameters are free
     *											  1: 6th order radial distortion term (kc[4]) is fixed
     *											  2: 6th order radial distortion and one of the tangential
	 *												 distortion terms (kc[3]) are fixed
     *											  3: 6th order radial distortion and both tangential distortion
	 *												 terms (kc[3], kc[2]) are fixed [i.e., only 2nd & 4th order
	 *												 radial dist.]
     *											  4: 4th & 6th order radial distortion terms and both tangential
	 *												 distortion ones are fixed [i.e., only 2nd order radial dist.]
     *											  5: all distortion parameters are kept fixed to their initial
	 *												 values
     *											  >5: meaningless
     *											  Used only when calibration varies among cameras and distortion
	 *											  is to be estimated
	 * int BAnconstframes				Input  -> Number of frames or cameras beginning from the first for which
	 *											  their parameters (exrinsic and intrinsic) should be kept fixed.
	 *											  This is, e.g., useful when the world's coordinate frame is
	 *											  aligned with taht of the first camera, therefore the (projective)
	 *											  first camera matrix should be kept fixed to [I|0].
	 * int BAnconst3Dpts				Input  -> Number of structure elements (3D points) beginning from the first
	 *											  should be kept fixed. This is, e.g., useful if a few structure
	 *											  elements are known to be exact.
	 * bool BAcam0IntrVarRtFix          Input  -> If true [Default = false] and BAnconstframes = 0, R & t are kept fixed
	 *                                            for the first camera but the intrinsics and distortion coefficients
	 *                                            are allowed to vary.
